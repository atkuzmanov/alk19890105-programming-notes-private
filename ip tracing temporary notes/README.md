Steps to Trace IP address-

1. Go to http://whatstheirip.com
2. Enter your email address ( Doesn't work with Yahoo mails) \ You Can use Temporary Mail https://mytemp.email/
3. You will get links with tracking code installed.
4. Send that link to the person once they open that link you will get and email with their IP address.
5. Go to www.iplocation.net and lookup for their IP address.

But the generated links look ugly and are not actionable, to make it more actionable follow these steps.

1. Once you get traceable link head toward http://bit.ly and shorten that URL.
2 Edit the title and URL to make it more actionable. You can write the title like " Master tricks for Pokemon Go" or anything which are popular.
3. Send the bitly URL to the person.
4. Once they click on that link you will get 2 mails on your email.
1st mail would contain bitly bot's IP address.
2nd mail would have that person's IP address.
5. GO to http://www.ip-tracker.org/ and lookup for the IP.

If you shorten URL using bitly then don't get confused with bot click and IP.
Remember, till you don't send bitly URL any mail having IP address is bot's IP.

After you send URL the first mail would contain bot IP and 2nd mail would contain Person's IP address.

First you got to find out the IP address of that User.
To Do so we will be using “netstat” command in windows. If you want to know the IP address of a specific person on facebook or orkut or any chat service, there is only one way: Just invite or ping him for a chat and while chat is ON open ‘Command Prompt‘ on your PC (Start >Run>cmd).

 

note: before trying this make sure you close all the other tabs in your browser, and only keep facebook open. Also if possible delete all the history and cache from your browser.

 

When command prompt opens Type the following command and hit Enter.

netstat -an
And you will get all established connections IP addresses there. Note down all the suspicious IP’s.

 

The Next Step is to Trace that user using his IP address.
To do so we will be using IP tracer service. Go to the below address and paste the IP address in the box that says “lookup this ip or website”, and it will show you the location of the user.

 

http://www.ip-adress.com/ipaddresstolocation/

 

It will show you all the information about that user along with his ISP and a Location in the MAP. Now in the MAP Just click on “click for big ip address location” in the big picture you can actually zoom in. and try to recognize the area. If any serious matter just note down the ISP details in that page and contact them about the IP. They will respond you.

 

Other netstat commands:

-a Displays all connections and listening ports.
-e Displays Ethernet statistics. This may be combined with the -s option.
-n Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
-p Proto Shows connections for the protocol specified by proto; proto may be TCP or UDP.
-s Option to display per-protocol statistics, proto may be TCP, UDP, or IP.
-r Displays the routing table.
-s Displays per-protocol statistics. By default, statistics are shown for TCP, UDP and IP; the
-p Option may be used to specify a subset of the default.

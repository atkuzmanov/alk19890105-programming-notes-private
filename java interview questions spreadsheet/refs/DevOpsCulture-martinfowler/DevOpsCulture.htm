<p>Agile software development has broken down some of the silos
  between requirements analysis, testing and development. Deployment,
  operations and maintenance are other activities which have suffered a similar
  separation from the rest of the software development process. The
  DevOps movement is aimed at removing these silos and encouraging
  collaboration between development and operations.</p>

<p>DevOps has become possible largely due to a combination of new
  operations tools and established agile engineering
  practices <span class="foot-ref"><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html#footnote-tools">[1]</a></span>, but these are not enough to
  realize the benefits of DevOps. <b>Even with the best
  tools, DevOps is just another buzzword if you don't have the
  right culture</b>.</p>

<p>The primary characteristic of DevOps culture is <b>increased collaboration</b>
  between the roles of development and operations. There are some important
  cultural shifts, within teams and at an organizational level, that support
  this collaboration.</p>

<div class="photo-right "><img src="./DevOpsCulture_files/devops_culture.png" title="DevOps requires an important cultural shift, within teams and in the               organization">
<p class="photoCaption"></p>
</div>

<p>An attitude of <b>shared responsibility</b> is an aspect of
  DevOps culture that encourages closer collaboration. It’s easy for a
  development team to become disinterested in the operation and
  maintenance of a system if it is handed over to another team to look
  after. If a development team shares the responsibility of looking
  after a system over the course of its lifetime, they are able to
  share the operations staff’s pain and so identify ways to simplify
  deployment and maintenance (e.g. by automating deployments and
  improving logging). They may also gain additional
  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObservedRequirement.html">ObservedRequirements</a> from monitoring the system in
  production. When operations staff share responsibility of a system’s
  business goals, they are able to work more closely with developers
  to better understand the operational needs of a system and help meet
  these. In practice, collaboration often begins with an increased
  awareness from developers of operational concerns (such as
  deployment and monitoring) and the adoption of new automation tools
  and practices by operations staff.</p>

<p>Some organizational shifts are required to support a culture of
  shared responsibilities. There should be <b>no silos</b> between
  development and operations. Handover periods and documentation are a
  poor substitute for working together on a solution from the start.
  It is helpful to adjust resourcing structures to allow operations
  staff to get involved with teams early. Having the developers and
  operations staff co-located will help them to work together.
  Handovers and sign-offs discourage people from sharing
  responsibility and contributes to a culture of blame. Instead,
  developers and operations staff should both be responsible for the
  successes and failures of a system. DevOps culture blurs the line
  between the roles of developer and operations staff and may
  eventually eliminate the distinction. One common anti-pattern when
  introducing DevOps to an organization is to assign someone the role
  of 'DevOps' or to <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/separate-devops-team">call
  a team a 'DevOps team'</a>. Doing so perpetuates the kinds of silos
  that DevOps aims to break down and prevents DevOps culture and
  practices from spreading and being adopted by the wider
  organization.</p>

<p>Another valuable organizational shift is to support <b>autonomous
  teams</b>. In order to collaborate effectively, developers and
  operations staff need to be able to make decisions and apply changes
  without convoluted decision making processes. This involves trusting
  teams, changing the way risk is managed and creating an environment that is free
  of a fear of failure. For example, a team that has to produce a list
  of changes for sign-off in order to deploy to a testing environment
  is likely to be delayed frequently. Instead of requiring such a manual
  check, it is possible to rely on version control, which is fully auditable.
  Changes in version control can even be linked to tickets in the team's
  project management tool. Without the manual sign-off, the team can
  automate their deployments and speed up their testing cycle.</p>

<p>One effect of a shift towards DevOps culture is that it becomes
  easier to put new code in production. This necessitates some further
  cultural changes. In order to ensure that changes in production are
  sound, the team needs to value <b>building quality into the development
  process</b>. This includes cross-functional concerns such as performance
  and security. The techniques of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html">ContinuousDelivery</a>, including
  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SelfTestingCode.html">SelfTestingCode</a>, form a basis which allows regular, low-risk
  deployments.</p>

<p>It is also important for the team to value <b>feedback</b>, in
  order to continuously improve the way in which developers and
  operations staff work together as well as the system itself.
  Production monitoring is a helpful feedback loop for diagnosing
  issues and spotting potential improvements.</p>

<p><b>Automation</b> is a cornerstone of the DevOps movement and
  facilitates collaboration. Automating tasks such as testing,
  configuration and deployment frees people up to focus on other
  valuable activities and reduces the chance of human error. A helpful
  side effect of automation is that automated scripts and tests serve
  as useful, always up-to-date documentation of the system. Automating
  server configuration, for example, removes the guesswork associated
  with a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html">SnowflakeServer</a> and means that developers and
  operations staff are equally able to know and change how a server
  is configured.</p>

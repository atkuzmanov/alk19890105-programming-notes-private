<p>In short, the microservice architectural style is an
      approach to developing a single application as a <b>suite of small
      services</b>, each <b>running in its own process</b> and communicating with
      lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These
      services are <b>built around business capabilities</b> and
      <b>independently deployable</b> by fully automated deployment
      machinery. There is a <b>bare minimum of centralized management</b> of
      these services, which may be written in different programming
      languages and use different data storage
      technologies.</p>

<section class="row intro">
<section>
<p>Late in 2013, hearing all the discussion in my circles
      about microservices, I became concerned that there was no
      clear definition of microservices (a fate that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceOrientedAmbiguity.html">caused many problems for
      SOA</a>). So I got together with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/boicy">James Lewis</a>, who was one of
      the more experienced practitioners of this style. Together we
      wrote</p>

<section class="picture ms-article">

</p><p class="caption"></p>
<p></p>
</section>

<p>We wrote the article to provide <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">a firm definition for the
      microservices style</a>, which we did by listing the common
      characteristics of microservice architectures that we saw in the
      field.</p>

<ul class="common-chars">
<li>Componentization via Services</li>

<li>Organized around Business Capabilities</li>

<li>Products not Projects</li>

<li>Smart endpoints and dumb pipes</li>

<li>Decentralized Governance</li>

<li>Decentralized Data Management</li>

<li>Infrastructure Automation</li>

<li>Design for failure</li>

<li>Evolutionary Design</li>
</ul>

<p>We also looked at common questions such as "how big is a
      microservice" and "what's the difference between microservices
      and Service-Oriented Architecture". The article catalyzed interest in
      microservices.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://martinfowler.com/videos.html#microservices">short introductory talk</a> (~25 minutes) I

      before putting a first microservice system into
      production.</p>

<h2>When should we use Microservices?</h2>

<p>Any architectural style has trade-offs: strengths and weaknesses that we
    must evaluate according to the context that it's used. This is certainly the
    case with microservices. While it's a useful architecture - many,
    indeed most, situations would do better with a monolith.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices
  architectural style</a> has been the hot topic over the last year.
  At the recent <a href="http://softwarearchitecturecon.com/sa2015">O'Reilly software
  architecture conference</a>, it seemed like every session talked
  about microservices. Enough to get everyone's over-hyped-bullshit
  detector up and flashing. One of the consequences of this is that
  we've seen teams be too eager to embrace microservices,  not
  realizing that microservices introduce complexity on their own
  account. This adds a premium to a project's cost and risk - one that
  often gets projects into serious trouble. </p>

<p>As I hear stories about teams using a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices architecture</a>, I've
    noticed a common pattern.</p>

<ol>
<li>Almost all the successful microservice stories have started with a
      monolith that got too big and was broken up</li>

<li>Almost all the cases where I've heard of a system that was built as a
      microservice system from scratch, it has ended up in serious trouble.</li>
</ol>

<p>This pattern has led many of my colleagues to argue that <b>you
    shouldn't start a new project with microservices, even if you're
    sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.
    </b>.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-image"><img src="./Microservices Guide_files/monolith-theory-practice.png"></p>

<p> In the last few months, I’ve heard repeatedly that the only way to
get to a successful microservices architecture is by starting with a
monolith first. To
paraphrase Simon Brown: If you can’t build a well-structured
monolith, what makes you think you can build a well-structured set of
microservices? The most recent – and, as usual, very convincing –
rendering of this argument comes from Martin Fowler on this very site. As I had
a chance to comment on an earlier draft, I had some time to think
about this. And I did, especially because I usually find myself in
agreement with him, and some others whose views I typically share
seemed to agree with him, too.
</p>

<p>I’m firmly convinced that starting with a monolith is usually exactly the
wrong thing to do.

<p>As I talk to people about using a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices architectural
  style</a> I hear a lot of optimism. Developers enjoy working with
  smaller units and have expectations of better modularity than with
  monoliths. But as with any architectural decision there are
  trade-offs. In particular with microservices there are serious
  consequences for operations, who now have to handle an ecosystem of
  small services rather than a single, well-defined monolith.
  Consequently if you don't have certain baseline competencies, you
  shouldn't consider using the microservice style.</p>

<h2>Building Microservices</h2>

<p>Microservice architectures are fairly new, but I've been fortunate that
    we've worked with them at ThoughtWorks since their <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/microservices">earliest appearances</a>. For a cohesive description of how
    best to work with them, the best introduction is Sam Newman's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950358?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1491950358">Building Microservices</a><img src="./Microservices Guide_files/ir" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"> which he wrote based on

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-image"><img src="./Microservices Guide_files/meta-image.png"></p>

<p class="abstract">
        There has been a shift in service based architectures over the last few
        years towards smaller, more focussed "micro" services. There are many
        benefits with this approach such as the ability to independently
        deploy, scale and maintain each component and
        parallelize development across multiple teams. However,
        once these additional network partitions have been introduced, the
        testing strategies that applied for monolithic in process applications
        need to be reconsidered.
       
        Here, we plan to discuss a number of approaches for managing
        the additional testing complexity of multiple independently
        deployable components as well as how to have tests and the application
        remain correct despite having multiple teams each acting as guardians for
        different services.

<p class="abstract">As monolithic systems become too large to deal with, many
  enterprises are drawn to breaking them down into the microservices
  architectural style. It is a worthwhile journey, but not an easy one. We've
  learned that to do this well, we need to start with a simple service, but then
  draw out services that are based on vertical capabilities that are important
  to the business and subject to frequent change. These services should be large
  at first and preferably not dependent upon the remaining monolith. We should
  ensure that each step of migration represents an atomic improvement to the
  overall architecture.</p>

    Good frontend development is hard. Scaling frontend development so that many
    teams can work simultaneously on a large and complex product is even harder.
    In this article we'll describe a recent trend of breaking up frontend
    monoliths into many smaller, more manageable pieces, and how this
    architecture can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of teams working
    on frontend code. As well as talking about the various benefits and costs,
    we'll cover some of the implementation options that are available, and we'll
    dive deep into a full example application that demonstrates the technique.

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-image"><img src="./Microservices Guide_files/card(1).png"></p>

<p class="abstract">When breaking monoliths into smaller services, the hardest part is
  actually breaking up the data that lives in the database of the monolith. To
  extract a data-rich service, it is useful to follow a series of steps which
  retain a single write-copy of the data at all times. The steps begin by making
  a logical separation in the existing monolith: splitting service behavior into
  a separate module, then separating data into a separate table. These elements
  can be separately moved into a new autonomous service.</p>

<p>Infrastructure as code is the approach to defining computing and network
  infrastructure through source code that can then be treated just like any software
  system. Such code can be kept in source control to allow auditability and

  deal with growing <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CloudComputing.html">CloudComputing</a> platforms and will become the dominant way
  to handle computing infrastructure in the next.</p>

<p>Agile software development has broken down some of the silos
  between requirements analysis, testing and development. Deployment,
  operations and maintenance are other activities which have suffered a similar
  separation from the rest of the software development process. The
  DevOps movement is aimed at removing these silos and encouraging
  collaboration between development and operations.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-image"><img src="./Microservices Guide_files/sketch(2).png"></p>

<p>It's common for software systems to make remote calls to software
  running in different processes, probably on different machines
  across a network. One of the big differences between in-memory calls
  and remote calls is that remote calls can fail, or hang without a
  response until some timeout limit is reached. What's worse if you
  have many callers on a unresponsive supplier, then you can run out
  of critical resources leading to cascading failures across multiple
  systems. In his excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0978739213?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0978739213">Release
  It</a><img src="./Microservices Guide_files/ir" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">, Michael Nygard popularized the Circuit Breaker pattern to
  prevent this kind of catastrophic cascade.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the circuit breaker is very simple. You
  wrap a protected function call in a circuit breaker object, which monitors for
  failures. Once the failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit
  breaker trips, and all further calls to the circuit breaker return
  with an error, without the protected call being made at all. Usually
  you'll also want some kind of monitor alert if the circuit breaker
  trips.</p>

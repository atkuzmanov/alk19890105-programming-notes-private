I was just wondering, if all of my authentication is now using the JWT token, does this mean that we do not need Laravel to create a XSRF-TOKEN and laravel_session for each response to the front-end?  Similarly, does this also mean that we do not need AngularJS to create the XSRF-TOKEN cookie and X-XSRF-TOKEN header?</p><p>I am still a little confused as to whether these techniques should be combined with JWT authorization in some way??? :)</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

2 field (id, token)<br>2 - I've added the id of the token to the payload</p><p>1- when a user logout (DELETE /sign_out) It deletes the token from the server<br>2- I have an hourly worker that cleans up the expired tokens<br>this way every hour the old expired tokens are cleared...<br>3- If a user tries to login with a token, just check if the id in the payload (or the token itself ) exists or not... If it doesn't then he must have been logged out before...<br>---<br>PS This solution should work with only the id field, and in fact it's more secure (incase of a breach), but I needed to save the token and many other "session" info for other purposes )</p><p>If you think that this might have a problems... please share with me what you think :D</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

I don't think that this solution is stateful...<br>And correct me if I'm wrong, The server doesn't save any "state" about the user... And the user token (as a resource) save info about it's own state much like a user post...<br>It belong to a user and much like a user post... He can delete it...<br>I think of the jwt much like a "handshake" between the received request and the api... Not as a token of authenticity...</p><p>The server issues it and validate its validity (and more importantly its ) existence with each request... Which I don't think (IMHO) invalidate the stateless principle...</p><p>One last note about the scenario you are describing... From what I understand... You oppose that if a user generated (forged) a valid token (that was not generated by the api) the request should be authenticated correctly and valid... If that is correct, I feel that its insecure solution... A token that the API didn't generate is valid ?</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

wonderful, tutorial with detailed explanation of concepts.</p><p>I am just beginning to explore the possibility of using angularjs with laravel 5. While going through many articles regarding using angular for beginners, I came across a strong opinion that says "DO NOT USE JQUERY IN ANGULAR PROJECT" and "THINK IN ANGULAR", meaning try avoiding jquery as long as you can while developing with angularjs which will force one to try and get solutions which are angular specific and not dirty quick fixes.</p><p>Going by those opinions, is there a way to not use jquery and still achieve what you have demonstrated here?</p><p>Is it possible to get the example working with jqlite included with angular? Or is the full jQuery library required?</p><p>I am planning on using ui-router, so instead of using $httpProvider interceptor, I will have to push the request and responseError to $stateProvider interceptor - Am I right?</p><p>Please excuse me if you find my questions to be silly. I will really appreciate your help in understanding these things.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see

Just one thing. I downloaded your code, and it is running here almost 100% ok. The only point i have doubt is on checking out... I have to click 3 or more times to get it ou from restricted area... it is like the token keeps alive after the first clicks.  Do you have any idea about what can be causing this?

Very timely since there isn't really another Laravel 5/AngularJS JWT tutorial on the web yet.</p><p>I have a slightly different use case than your sample. I want (need) to decouple the applications so the Laravel 5 API is a totally separate application from the AngularJS client application. The reason I need this is because I will actually end up with a "Staff" client app (Angular), a "Client" client app (Angular), a "Client" mobile app (Ionic) that will all consume the Laravel API.</p><p>I read your article and then I went back through it and followed along and was able to reproduce your example. Can you point me in the right direction as to the changes I will need to make to now adapt your example into my use case. I think I will need to make the /login route part of the API and create the login page on the client where a successful login will receive and locally store the JWT but I am not sure how to accomplish this.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

For example, using JWT your server has an overhead exposed by token validation on each request (i.e. the same as in cookie-based). CORS issue wasn't described at all. Last point - remove coupling with framework looks true. But!..
